* to be added


### tasks:
- [x] copy 时间线TIMELINE.md to docs/index.md. Index.md will be the homepage of the website. I also replace | by a dot, because markdown use | for tables.
- [x] use a python script to extract data in docs/index.md into docs/_data/news.yml. This .yml file save each entry of the news in an array, so that we can change the layout or order as we want.
- [x] for a test of the data, I create docs/reversed.md to show all the news in reversed order, so that the newest post will come first.
- [x] Use a github action (.github/workflows/push-web.yml) to do the previous three steps automatically at every push. Note that it would show a commit fail, If none of 时间线TIMELINE.md or README.md changes. One can ignore this error message.
- [x] Some of the links might need to fix. For example, the first link in the read me page 疫情与舆情：武汉新冠肺炎时间线TIMELINE should change to [疫情与舆情：武汉新冠肺炎时间线TIMELINE](index), such that it will go from the "about" page to the "homepage"
- [x] In README.md, the | should replace by dot by hand.
- [x] Add "scroll to bottom button in index"
- [ ] Add [search page](https://github.com/dvop/dvop.github.io/tree/master/COVID-19)
